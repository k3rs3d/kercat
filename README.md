# Kercat: Tribute to Netcat in Rust

## Status: Work-in-Progress (WIP)

Kercat is currently in a very early stage of development. The primary goal of this project is to replicate the functionality of Netcat using Rust.

While the core objective is to mirror Netcat's main capabilities, Kercat may eventually include a few additional features or unique touches.

## Purpose

This project is more of a learning exercise rather than an attempt to create a superior tool to Netcat. I'm building this to explore networking concepts and learn the Rust language.

## Current Features

- Command-line interface for launching client and server ("listen") modes
- Basic logging to a file
- Placeholder structure for the eventual client and server modules

### Planned Features

- Full TCP/UDP client and server functionality
- Time delay interval feature
- Additional unique modes or options (e.g., Zero I/O mode for port scanning)
- More robust error handling and logging

## Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable version)
